Plan
----

Black shard will be an client-server based encrypted note taking application that will let users store text files in a safe full encrypted fashion either on their local machine or on a remote host being run on a server.
Users will be able to log in with a password to the server using a command line client and then access and decrypt notes using RSA, edit them with their text editor of choice, re-encrypt them and send them back to the server for storage.
The sever will implement users privileges and permissions to allow users to share some notes while keeping others private
Data will be stored using a nosql server eg. redis, mongo db.
The program will initially be written in python before being converted into C or C++
